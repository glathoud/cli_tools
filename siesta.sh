### Read the options

if [[ ($# -eq 1)  &&  ($1 -eq "-test") ]]

### Preparation

    #

    # (could not find a better way from within sudo)
    #
    # Practically, you can add the following line at the end of your .bashrc:
    # if [ -z `pgrep light-locker` ]; then light-locker & fi
    LLPID=$( pgrep "$LIGHT_LOCKER" )

            exit 1

### make sure we are root, because of rtcwake after screen lock
